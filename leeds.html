      <center>The Brunswick has been making headway as one of the city’s best roasts since it opened in 2015. They’ve been fine-tuning and perfecting it since then – and all their hard work has certainly paid off. You can get topside of beef for £13, chicken supreme for £12 or a nut roast for £11 – you can even swap your Yorkshire pudding for a vegan-friendly dose of sweet potato mash and olive oiled-carrots.All their roasts come with crispy roast potatoes, butter glazed carrots, sweetheart cabbage, gravy and a mini Bloody Mary.</center>

      <img src="kirkstall-bridge-roast-nov-2018-no-credit-1-1024x576.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <center>Kirkstall Bridge Inn is famous for its roasts. Expect big, loaded plates of food, served up in a homely setting, beside the river. You can choose from three types of meat – roast lamb shoulder, British beef brisket slow-cooked with garlic and British roast pork (get there early for crackling). Whichever you choose, it’s £11.50 for adults or £5 for kids, and your plate will come loaded with all the trimmings.</center>

      <center>If you want to eat your Sunday lunch in the lap of luxury, hunt out Gaucho’s Leeds restaurant. It’s hidden underground on Park Row – and it’s here that they cook up one of the most extravagant roasts in the city. It’s a two-course affair for £24.50, so you’ll start with the likes of salmon ceviche (or finish with pineapple carpaccio) – but the highlight is the roast itself. You can have roasted free-range chicken or roast sirloin of beef – it’s an extra £3.50 for the latter, but it’s what they do best, so go on, splash out. Whichever you choose, you’ll get broccoli, roast potatoes, carrots tossed in churrasco sauce and a plump Yorkshire pudding cooked in beef dripping, all doused in red wine gravy.</center>

      <center>He’s the master of classic British food, but he puts his own stamp on it, so it stands to reason that Masterchef: The Professionals runner-up Matt Healy has branched out into roast dinners. This particular Sunday lunch comes in at £19.95, but you can expect him to take your favourite meal to new heights. For the meat-eaters, it’s 12-hour roasted beef sirloin and roast chicken, while veggies can snaffle a traditional mushroom wellington. They all come with roast potatoes, carrots, greens, cauliflower cheese and a Yorkshire pud, with their homemade gravy.</center>

      <center>A proper old school pub that serves a proper Sunday dinner – The Adelphi is full of nooks and crannies, perfect for cosying up in. Order a pint, find yourself a spot and start the tricky task of deciding what to order. You can have 21-day aged sirloin of beef for £11.75, rosemary and garlic rubbed leg of lamb for £12.25 or orange & whiskey gammon joint for £10.75 – all with red wine jus. And if you fancy Shropshire roast chicken, you can get a half for £10.75 or a whole one to share for £19.50, both with gingerbread stuffing and chicken gravy. All their roasts come with beef dripping roasties, except the nut roast, which is served with baby potatoes and veggie gravy. You’ll also get homemade Yorkshire puddings, roasted vegetables and braised red cabbage.</center>

      <img src="cardigan-arms-roast-nov-2018-reece-leung-1-1024x576.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <center>The Cardigan Arms is a local institution that’s been brought back to life by Kirkstall Brewery. That means you have three irresistible reasons to go – the wonderful historic feel, the quality beer offering, and now, that cracking roast dinner. It’s served from 12pm to 5pm every Sunday and there’s something for everyone, all for £11.50. Their meats change every week, so you could have anything from thinly sliced topside of beef to roasted leg of lamb. They have a roasted root vegetable nut loaf for the veggies, and everyone gets roast potatoes, carrots, parsnips, savoy cabbage and what might well be the biggest Yorkshire pudding you’ve ever seen.</center>
