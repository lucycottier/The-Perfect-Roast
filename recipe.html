						<p>
							1.  Put a roasting tin in the oven (one big enough to take the potatoes in a single layer) and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.<br>
							2.  Peel the 1kg potatoes and cut each into 4 even-sized pieces if they are medium size, 2-3 if smaller (5cm pieces).<br>
							3.  Drop the potatoes into a large pan and pour in enough water to barely cover them.<br>
							4.  Add salt, then wait for the water to boil. As soon as the water reaches a full rolling boil, lower the heat, put your timer on and simmer the potatoes uncovered, reasonably vigorously, for 2 mins.<br>
              5.  Meanwhile, put 100g duck or goose fat or 100ml olive oil into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a few mins, so it’s really hot. <br>
              6.  Drain the potatoes in a colander then shake the colander back and forth a few times to fluff up the outsides.<br>
              7.  Sprinkle with 2 tsp flour and give another shake or two so they are evenly and thinly coated.<br>
              8.  Carefully put the potatoes into the hot fat – they will sizzle as they go in – then turn and roll them around so they are coated all over.<br>
              9.  Spread them in a single layer making sure they have plenty of room.<br>
              10. Roast the potatoes for 15 mins, then take them out of the oven and turn them over.<br>
              11. Roast for another 15 mins and turn them over again. Put them back in the oven for another 10-20 mins, or however long it takes to get them really golden and crisp. The colouring will be uneven, which is what you want.<br>
              12. Scatter with Maldon salt and serve straight away.
